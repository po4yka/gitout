WARNING  | Automated review failed for InterviewQuestions/70-Kotlin/q-cold-vs-hot-flows--kotlin--medium.md:
The automated workflow converged on a technically sound and bilingual-consistent note, but stalled on four low-severity warnings that require explicit human judgment or stable formatting. Most substantive issues (Flow semantics, examples, parity, and structural correctness) were successfully resolved. The remaining blockers are a metadata warning about future-dated timestamps and missing backticks around `Flow`, `StateFlow`, and `SharedFlow` mentions, which triggered oscillation in the auto-fix loop. A brief manual pass to confirm or adjust the timestamps and to wrap those specific type names in backticks should bring the note to a fully passing state.

INFO     | Technical review made changes: I reviewed all code samples, explanations, and best practices for correctness and alignment with Kotlin semantics and the vault's expectations.

Key checks and fixes:
- Extension basics and examples were validated; clarified that the email check is simplified and emphasized receiver-lambda usage for applyIf.
- Generic extensions: kept `second()` but added an explicit note that it assumes size >= 2 to make edge-case behavior clear. The sorted check using `zipWithNext` is correct.
- Fixed the reified example: the custom `filterIsInstance` previously shadowed the stdlib and caused infinite recursion; renamed it to `filterAsType` and implemented it via the standard `filterIsInstance`.
- Extension properties: confirmed semantics and added a note that they do not introduce backing fields, which is important for advanced understanding.
- Resolution and scope: clarified the example to correctly demonstrate that a member extension inside a class is preferred when both member and top-level extensions are in scope, and expanded the comment to describe the rule precisely.
- Operator extensions: added a simple `Version` class so the compareTo example is self-contained; noted that range-based get assumes valid indices.
- DSL example: adjusted `HtmlBuilder.tag` to call `this.block()` explicitly and clarified in text that it is a minimal, flattened example, avoiding confusion about real HTML tree modeling.
- Context receivers: made it explicit that they require appropriate Kotlin version and flags, and added minimal interfaces for `Logger`, `Transaction`, and `Order` so the snippet is type-correct and self-contained.
- RU section was expanded to mirror the EN technical content at a concise summary level while maintaining bilingual alignment and preserving formatting conventions.
- Flagged a minor taxonomy concern: some YAML subtopics (dsl, extensions, generics) are not listed in the provided taxonomy; left YAML unchanged per instructions but highlighted this in issues_found.
